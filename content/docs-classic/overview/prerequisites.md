{{< callout context="caution" title="Important" >}} LDAPCP Classic is deprecated. Migrating to LDAPCP SE is [safe and easy]({{< relref "/docs-se/guides/upgrade-from-classic" >}}). {{< /callout >}}

LDAPCP has the following requirements:

- A SharePoint 2013 farm or newer.
- A trusted authentication configured as documented in [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/security-for-sharepoint-server/implement-saml-based-authentication-in-sharepoint-server).
